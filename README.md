### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rob and I've been working in tech since the 90's and always keen on automation. 
I am the Cloud Services Lead, focussed on product delivery, development, automation, engineering and architecture. My team provides Platform as a Service to host Esri ArcGIS Enterprise software, to allow GIS professionals to focus on the mapping, services, and applications. We perform the deployment, maintenance and upgrades to the cloud provider, Operating Systems and Esri Software as required.

<br>

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
Writing and documenting the implementation of various tools and practices as part of my day to day work. Hoping to publish content that that helps others on their automation journey and to fill in the gaps of the Devops delivery operations. 

<br>

## ðŸŒ± Technical Skills
I have a broad set of technical skills that I continuously develop, I don't know all of the things and always learning new things. Its inevitable that I'll write poor code or create something quick that could use refactoring later on. Continous improvement should always lead you to review what you've done and seek to improve. With that in mind if you see something that I can improve please feel free to reach out.

## :books: Study

Planning on certifying a number of my skills and development in the next year.

[AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional) - I am working through Adrian Cantrills materials currently, I find Adrian's course material is written with practial application in mind, you aren't simply learning the answers or how to pass an exam. You are learning how to put the material to work in the real world.

CICD Pipelines - Infrastrucutre as code is a challenging construct, you need to architect and standardise deployments while supporting feature enhancements. Solid development processes and testing are key to ensuring that progress is made. I'll publish my works and findings as they develop.

Event Driven Automation - As a Systems Administrator I found the need for people to take action in response to alerts or other other monitored events a shocking way to maintain services. I'm also fond of sleep, and since these events can decide to wake me up, why can't it take remediative actions, and if that fails then wake me up :)
