### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rob and I've been working in tech since the 90's and always keen on automation. 
I specialize in Automation, scaling, managed and cloud services, focussed on product delivery, development, automation, engineering and architecture. My professional work has focussed on Platform as a Service to host specialist Enterprise software, performing the deployment, maintenance and upgrades to the solution, Operating Systems and Software as required.
All content and information published here is my own work and research. The information is provided as is and anyone making use of this information takes responsibility for the costs and risks associated with that action.

<br>

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
Writing and documenting the implementation of various tools and practices learned over my career. Hoping to publish content that that helps others on their automation journey and to fill in the gaps of the Devops delivery operations. 

<br>

## ðŸŒ± Technical Skills
I have a broad set of technical skills that I continuously develop, I don't know all of the things and always learning new things. Its inevitable that I'll write poor code or create something quick that could use refactoring later on. Continous improvement should always lead you to review what you've done and seek to improve. With that in mind if you see something that I can improve please feel free to reach out.

## :books: Study

Planning on certifying a number of my skills and development in the next year.

AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional - On hold

Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) - I'm daily driving Linux at home on all my machines, in my work I will use WSL for all development work where possible.

Certified Kubernetes Security (CKS) - Enhancing my usage of Kubernetes beyond the basics and tracking the wider usage is showing that Kubernetes security is a non-negotiable to hosting a robust product.

CICD Pipelines - Infrastrucutre as code is a challenging construct, you need to architect and standardise deployments while supporting feature enhancements. Solid development processes and testing are key to ensuring that progress is made. I'll publish my works and findings as they develop.

Event Driven Automation - As a Systems Administrator I found the need for people to take action in response to alerts or other other monitored events a shocking way to maintain services. I'm also fond of sleep, and since these events can decide to wake me up, why can't it take remediative actions, and if that fails then wake me up :)
